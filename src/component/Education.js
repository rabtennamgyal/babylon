                    The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular 
                    activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place. 
                    Such financial activities are conducted through institutionalized formal exchanges or 
                    over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces which operate under a defined set of regulations. 
                    There can be multiple stock trading venues in a country or a region which allow transactions 
                    in stocks and other forms of securities.

                    Inflation is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over time.
                    A quantitative estimate of the rate at which the decline in purchasing power occurs can
                    be reflected in the increase of an average price level of a basket of selected goods 
                    and services in an economy over some period of time. The rise in the general level
                    of prices, often expressed as a percentage, means that a unit of currency effectively
                    buys less than it did in prior periods.
